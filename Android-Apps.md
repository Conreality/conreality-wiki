The **Conreality apps for Android** are apps for the Android mobile
operating system, aimed at Conreality gamemasters, players, and spectators.

Conreality Player for Android
-----------------------------

The player app runs on a wearable device carried by each player.

At present, the app targets phones and tablets. We anticipate that in the
future it will run on and explicitly support augmented-reality headsets
(e.g., Google Glass) as well, and that this will be the primary use case.
