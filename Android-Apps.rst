The **Conreality apps for Android** are apps for the Android mobile
operating system, aimed at Conreality gamemasters, players, and
spectators.

Conreality Player for Android
=============================

The player app runs on a wearable device carried by each player.

At present, the app targets phones and tablets. We anticipate that in
the future it will run on and explicitly support augmented-reality
headsets (e.g., Google Glass) as well, and that this will be the primary
use case.

-  Enables the configuration of the player's nickname and avatar.

-  Enables players to track the current positions (distance and
   coordinates) of teammates.

-  Provides a personal area network (PAN) for accessories and gadgets.
