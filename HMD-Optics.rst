In terms of HMD utility we need an eye-like camera to not impair the
user e.g. by limiting their peripheral vision. This makes most webcams
unusable for HMDs, with their limited field of view commonly being only
50 to 70 degrees. The human binocular field of view covers 114 degrees
with another 40 degrees of monocular vision on either side. 

As with eyes, with cameras too to increase the field of vision you can
lower the focal length between the lens and the focal point (back of the
eyeball or the camera sensor). The human eye has a focal length of 17mm.
*However this does not mean that the more matching focal length is
necessarily the better one.* With a wide enough field of view
in cameras it becomes a fisheye view.

Optimally we use an fisheye lens to achieve larger viewing angles.
While it distorts the image around the edges and otherwise messes with
the perspective, the peripheral vision of a wide angle camera is needed.
Lenses are cheap to change for trial-and-erroring and possible image
problems can be compesated for software-wise.
