Consensus Reality
=================

*"Don't panic, it's just a game."*

**Consensus Reality** (aka **Conreality**) is a live-action
[augmented-reality](Glossary#augmented-reality), tactical
[wargame](Glossary#wargame) currently in an early design and planning phase.

There is nothing much to see here unless you're an experienced software
developer capable of building the system from scratch and figuring things
out on your own as needed. Otherwise, check back on us in a year or two.
