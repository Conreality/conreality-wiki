Hardware Needed
---------------

This is a prioritized list of hardware currently needed for the project.
In case you happen to have one of these devices lying around collecting
dust, please consider donating it to the project. For logistics, please
contact one of the project leads.

**This list may not always be up to date, so it is probably best to contact
one of the project leads for a more current list.**

### Immediate Utility

The following items are of clear and present utility to the project:

#### Brushless Gimbals

We need a good-quality 2-axis or 3-axis brushless gimbal to demonstrate
precise target tracking and engagement. The specific hardware hasn't been
selected yet; @ab0032 is presently working on researching the best options
here.

Budget: €100-200.

#### Fast & Precise Servos

Two of these 39€ [servos](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__77639__Turnigy_8482_TGY_DS525MG_Coreless_HV_DS_Tail_Servo_w_Alloy_Case_760us_7_5kg_0_0_EU_Warehouse_.html) for one turret plus brackets or four for two turrets would be very appreciated.

Two of these 6€ standard sized servo [brackets](https://nodna.de/Aluminum-Multi-Purpose-Servo-Bracket_1) per turret are needed with the servos. 

Budget: €100-200.

#### Localization Modules

We need some [DWM1000](http://www.decawave.com/products/dwm1000-module)
real-time location tracking modules in order to implement localization,
i.e., have Conreality nodes know each others' current physical locations and
cooperate effectively on target tracking and engagement.

The most useful quantity would be 4 of these modules in order to use 3 of
them as fixed-position anchors and 1 as a moving object, enabling us to
complete the full implementation of localization. However, even just 2
modules would already be useful in order to build the driver support for
them and obtain the ranging measurements.

Budget: ~€30 each, therefore ~€120 for 4 modules.

#### RobotGeek Webcam Kit

This is an add-on kit for our existing RobotGeek Desktop RoboTurret to
convert it to do object tracking:

Available in the EU from
[Generation Robots](http://www.generationrobots.com/en/402260-robotgeek-webcam-with-mounts.html)
(€41).

### High Utility

The following items are not on the critical path but would be helpful to
have access to as early as possible to ensure that development is on the
right track:

#### XBee Radio Modules

We could use two XBee radio modules for field tests and to develop driver
support for them.

Budget: €100

#### Crazyflie Drone

We could use a [Crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/) drone
for prototype development.

Budget: €150

#### Augmented Reality Headset

We could use early access to [an augmented-reality headset](AR-Headsets) in
order to grok the parameters and begin development of the tactical user
interface.

### Nice-to-Haves

The following items are mostly just nice-to-haves in case someone happens to
have the hardware lying around:

* [BeagleBone Black](http://beagleboard.org/black)
* [Adafruit Mini Pan/Tilt Kit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1967)
* Fat Shark Pan/Tilt Camera Mount (FS-1602)
* Fat Shark Pan/Tilt/Roll Camera Mount (FS-1603)
* [CMUcam5 Pixy Sensor](http://www.cmucam.org/projects/cmucam5/wiki)
