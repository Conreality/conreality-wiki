ArduPilot - Control Copters, Planes, Rovers and Boats
-----------------------------------------------------

ArduPilot is a popular open source autopilot created by Andrew Tridgell
and others. The software consists of two major parts, the firmeware that
is loaded onto the vehicle and the part that runs on the PC to control
and plan missions and load firmware.

It was ported to a linux environment `Video on Port to
Linux <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4VcLcDQSE>`__.

"ArduPilot (also ArduPilotMega - APM) is an open source unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) platform, able to control autonomous multicopters,
fixed-wing aircraft, traditional helicopters and ground rovers.
Ardupilot is an award winning platform that won the 2012 and 2014 UAV
Outback Challenge competitions . It was created in 2007 by the DIY
Drones community.It is based on the Arduino open-source electronics
prototyping platform. The first Ardupilot version was based on a
thermopile, which relies on determining the location of the horizon
relative to the aircraft by measuring the difference in temperature
between the sky and the ground. Later, the system was improved to
replace thermopiles with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) using a
combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers.

Today, the ArduPilot project has evolved to a range of hardware and
software products, including the APM and Pixhawk/PX4 line of autopilots,
and the ArduCopter, ArduPlane and ArduRover software projects." - Source
