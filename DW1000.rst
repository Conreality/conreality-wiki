The DWM1000 module is based on Decawave's DW1000 Ultra Wideband (UWB)
transceiver IC. It integrates antenna, all RF circuitry, power
management and clock circuitry in one module. It can be used in 2-way
ranging or TDOA location systems to locate assets to a precision of 10
cm and supports data rates of up to 6.8 Mbps
