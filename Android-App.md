**Conreality for Android** is an app for the Android mobile operating
system, aimed at Conreality gamemasters and players.

At present, the app targets phones and tablets. We anticipate that in the
future it will run on and explicitly support augmented-reality headsets
(e.g., Google Glass) as well, and that this will be the primary use case.

Features
--------

* Enables gamemasters to [[set up|Game Setup]] a game scenario.
* Enables gamemasters to issue control commands to swarms and nodes.
* Enables players to track the current position of teammates.
