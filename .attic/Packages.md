Supported Systems
-----------------

We endeavor to build and distribute up-to-date binary packages for the
following indicated operating system and host architecture combinations:

| System                | i386    | amd64   | armv6l  | armhf   | Notes        |
| :-------------------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ | ------------ |
| Ubuntu 16.04 LTS      | N/A     |         |         |         |              |
| Ubuntu 14.04 LTS      | N/A     | Yes     | N/A     | TODO    |              |
| Debian Stretch 9.0    | N/A     |         |         |         |              |
| Debian Jessie 8.2     | N/A     | TODO    | TODO    | TODO    |              |

### Legend

* `Yes`: binary packages are available for this target.
* `TODO`: binary packages are in the works for this target.
* `N/A`: binary packages will **not** be made available for this target.

### Notes

* There are no current plans to produce 32-bit PC (`i386`) binary packages.
* [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/) is the port of Debian to `armv6l`.
* We are very interested in future ports to the [[RISC-V]] architecture.
