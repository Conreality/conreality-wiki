"Analyst Digi-Capital predicts an AR market of $90 billion annually by 2020,
compared to $30 billion for VR. [...] More surprisingly, given the relative
amounts of buzz, AR is already a much larger market than VR, with hundreds
of commercial, industrial, and military applications provided by literally
dozens of hardware and software vendors. Before it goes mainstream, though,
at least another generation or two of advances in hardware will be needed."
