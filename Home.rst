Conreality
==========

*"Don't panic, it's just a game."*

**Consensus Reality** (aka **Conreality**) is a live-action
`augmented-reality <Glossary#augmented-reality>`__, tactical
`wargame <Glossary#wargame>`__ platform currently in an early design and
development phase.

There is nothing much to see here unless you're an experienced software
developer capable of building the system from scratch and figuring
things out on your own as needed. Otherwise, check back on us in a year
or two.
