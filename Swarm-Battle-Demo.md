*"Creating art and beauty with our autonomous weapons systems."*

Also known as "Ballet & Battle", to be prospectively presented at [HCPP16](Events).

## Script

### Ballet

Presenter stands in front of a homogeneous group of 20 small drones. To the
tune of a sound track, he uses hand gestures to arm and prime the drones,
turning on their LEDs (initially of a homogeneous color), raising them into
the air (initially as one big swarm), dividing them into two distinct swarms
(LEDs change color accordingly, and drones regroup in the air into two
flocks), and designating their enemy swarm and letting them fire at will.

### Battle


## Questions

* Simultaneous radio control of multiple Crazyflies?

  * Low-tech solution: 20x Crazyradio PA USB dongles, connected to USB
    hub(s), configured to use different radio channels.

    * Cost of 20x dongles is non-ideal.

    * Availability and feasibility of 20-port USB hubs?
