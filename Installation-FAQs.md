#### Can I install Conreality on my Arduino board?

Not quite. Conreality doesn't run on microcontrollers (MCUs); you will need
a main board with a 32-bit or 64-bit processor (CPU) based on either the ARM
or the x86 computer architecture. The minimum memory (RAM) requirement is
64 MiB, though you'll be able to do more with a device with 512+ MiB of RAM.

We recommend the [[Raspberry Pi 3]] as a good default board for Conreality.
