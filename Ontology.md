The Consensus Reality ontology describes the simulation concepts in the form
of a machine-readable,
[RDFS](https://github.com/bendiken/consensus/wiki/Glossary#rdfs) and
[OWL](https://github.com/bendiken/consensus/wiki/Glossary#owl)-compatible
ontology.

The [master file](https://github.com/bendiken/consensus/blob/master/etc/rdf/ontology.ttl)
for the ontology is maintained under revision control at GitHub.

The Consensus Reality ontology is available for download in the
[Turtle](http://dydra.com/consensus/ontology.ttl),
[JSON-LD](http://dydra.com/consensus/ontology.jsonld), and
[RDF/XML](http://dydra.com/consensus/ontology.rdf) formats.

There is also a [SPARQL endpoint](http://dydra.com/consensus/ontology/sparql)
available to enable querying the ontology with
[SPARQL](https://github.com/bendiken/consensus/wiki/Glossary#sparql).
