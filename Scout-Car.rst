Our Mark I `scout car <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_car>`__ is a
robotic car based on the [[SunFounder Smart Video Car Kit|SunFounder Car
Kit]] for the [[Raspberry Pi]]. It can be used as a reconnaissance
vehicle in milsim scenarios or as an affordable development platform for
hacking on Conreality.
