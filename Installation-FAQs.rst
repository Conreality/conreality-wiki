What size SD memory card do I need to install Conreality?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current Conreality firmware installation requires a minimum of 100
MiB of space. Any remaining disk space can be used for user data such as
scenario scripts and assets.

Can I install Conreality on my Arduino board?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Not quite. Conreality doesn't run on microcontrollers (MCUs); you will
need a main board with a 32-bit or 64-bit processor (CPU) based on
either the ARM or the x86 computer architecture. The minimum memory
(RAM) requirement is 64 MiB, though you'll be able to do more with a
device with 512+ MiB of RAM.

We recommend the [[Raspberry Pi 3]] as a good default board for
Conreality.

What types of networking are supported?
