**The levels of difficulty have chiefly to do with the tempo of the game.**

At a high enough tempo, ultimately humans will be unable to comprehend in
real-time what is happening any longer, leading to panicked behavior and/or
shock-and-awe numbness. At that point, the robot team wins.

**Other factors for the difficulty levers include:**

* At lower difficulty levels, impose standard socially-acceptable
  constraints on the movement of robots, helping ensure that robot motion
  remains comprehensible and relatively "tame". At higher difficulty levels,
  no social constraints are imposed, enabling robot motion in ways that may
  be unexpected and jarring, even frightening, to humans.

* At the very highest difficulty levels, decrease the risk-aversion factor
  of the robots, enabling motion planning of trajectories that have a higher
  risk of failure and even potential damage to equipment.
